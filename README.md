- **0.8:**
  - ~~UI revision;~~
  - ~~Reorganize code & split files in ```game/```;~~

  - ~~Effects when:~~
    - ~~The snake eats food;~~
    - ~~Game speed increases;~~
  - ~~Gameplay: speed up over time (this completes classic mode);~~
  - ~~Credit myself (bottom right on menu screen);~~
  - ~~Remove  ```SDL2-image```  dependency;~~
  - Store highscores.
- **0.8:**
  - Final testing, polish & eventual bugfixes.

## FUTURE IDEAS ##

These things might never happen. They're here for future reference.

- Gameplay:
  - Endless mode with events and powerups;
  - "Vicinity food generation";
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor.
- Options:
  - Support multiple (or any) resolutions;
  - Full-screen.
- Misc:
  - Add notifications/warnings (like "Are you sure you want to quit?");
  - Sound (Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions);
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
  - AI for the snake.
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**
