*Snake* clone, by **Goga Tamas**

## BUGS ##

- (?) bug at button removal (working now, but in a hack-y way)

## PLANS ##
### 0.7.8: ###
  > credit myself (bottom right on menu screen)
### 0.8: ###
  > storing the score
  > proper icons for buttons (exit, options, etc.)
### 0.9: ###
  > sound (old-school bleeps; melody based on snake action)
  > vicinity food generation
1.0 -> testing, bug-fixes, removing unused code

## Future ideas: ##
- map editor, wall tiles
- multiple resolutions, full-screen
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**

## LICENSE ##

**All right reserved**, until I choose a license (something open-source, like MIT, most probably).
