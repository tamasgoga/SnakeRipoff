**Snake** clone, by _Goga Tamas_.

## BUGS ##
1. **Bug at button removal** (working now, but in a hacky way). This may not exist at this point.

## PLANS ##
- **0.8:**
  - Credit myself (bottom right on menu screen);
  - Store highscores.
- **1.0:**
  - Testing, bug-fixes, removing unused code.

## FUTURE IDEAS ##
- Gameplay:
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor;
  - Vicinity food generation.
- Options:
  - Multiple resolutions;
  - Full-screen.
- Sound:
  - Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions.
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**

## LICENSE ##

> **All right reserved**, until I choose a license (something open-source, like MIT, most probably).
