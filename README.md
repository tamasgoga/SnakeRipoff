## FUTURE IDEAS (that will never happen) ##

These things will never happen, but I'd like to keep them for my own future amusement.

- Gameplay:
  - Endless mode with events and powerups;
  - "Vicinity food generation";
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor.
- Options:
  - Support multiple (or any) resolutions;
  - Full-screen.
- Misc:
  - Add notifications/warnings (like "Are you sure you want to quit?");
  - Sound (Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions);
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
  - AI for the snake.
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**
