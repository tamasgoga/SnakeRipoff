[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game) "Wikipedia article") clone, by _Goga TamÃ¡s_.

## DEPENDENCIES ##
```SDL2```, ```SDL2-ttf``` -- [Setting up SDL2](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php); [Setting up SDL extensions](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/index.php)

## ROADMAP ##
- **0.8:**
  - UI revision;
  - ~~Reorganize code & split files in ```game/```;~~
  - ~~TTF: changeText() -> load in same place~~ -- _it already works like that_;
  - Effects when:
    - ~~The snake eats food;~~
    - Game speed increases;
  - ~~Gameplay: speed up over time (this completes classic mode);~~
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
  - ~~Credit myself (bottom right on menu screen);~~
  - ~~Remove  ```SDL2-image```  dependency.~~
- **1.0:**
  - Store highscores;
  - Proper ending on the off chance the player actually wins;
  - _(?) AI for the snake._

## FUTURE IDEAS ##
- Gameplay:
  - Endless mode with events and powerups;
  - "Vicinity food generation";
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor.
- Options:
  - Support multiple (or any) resolutions;
  - Full-screen.
- Misc:
  - Add notifications/warnings (like "Are you sure you want to quit?").
  - Sound (Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions);
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**
