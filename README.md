[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game) "Wikipedia article") clone, by _Goga TamÃ¡s_.

## CONTROLS ##
Use the ```arrow keys``` to move the snake. ```F1``` toggles _help mode_ (grid is clearly defined), for now.

## DEPENDENCIES ##
```SDL2```, ```SDL2-ttf``` -- [Setting up SDL2](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php); [Setting up SDL extensions](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/index.php)

## ROADMAP ##

These are the updates that are going to happen sooner or later.

- **1.0:**
  - Better random food generation;
  - Final testing, polish & potential bugfixes.

## FUTURE IDEAS ##

These things might never happen. They're here for future reference.

- Gameplay:
  - Endless mode with events and powerups;
  - "Vicinity food generation";
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor.
- Options:
  - Support multiple (or any) resolutions;
  - Full-screen.
- Misc:
  - Add notifications/warnings (like "Are you sure you want to quit?");
  - Sound (Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions);
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
  - AI for the snake.
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**
