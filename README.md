**Snake** clone, by _Goga Tamas_.

## BUGS ##
1. **Bug at button removal** (working now, but in a hacky way). Check commented out ~Button in `game/entities.hpp, line 47`.

## PLANS ##
- **0.8:**
  - Credit myself (bottom right on menu screen);
  - Actual random place for the snake to start from;
  - Vicinity food generation;
  - Support multiple (hopefully any) resolutions;
  - TTF: changeText() -> load in same place;
  - Effects when snake eats food & other actions;
  - Gameplay: speed up over time.
- **0.9:**
  - Sound (Old-school bleeps. Melody based on the snake's actions);
  - Store highscores;
  - Add notifications/warnings (like "Are you sure you want to quit?").
- **??:**
  - AI for the snake;
  - Proper ending.

- **1.0:**
  - Testing, bug-fixes, removing unused code.

## FUTURE IDEAS ##
- Gameplay:
  - Wall tiles;
  - Map editor;
  - Vicinity food generation.
- Options:
  - Full-screen.
- **No more _Core_ reworks.**

## LICENSE ##

> **All right reserved**, until I choose a license (something open-source, like MIT, most probably).
